my goal
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I output all winning games to the 12 ways to start a Tic-tac-toe game. Neither player is allowed to ignore an immediate win, and, after checking for a win, neither player is allowed to ignore blocking an immediate win. I prevent the most obvious symmetric solutions from appearing more than once by preventing "repeated" boards in the first three moves. Here are the 12 ways to start a Tic-tac-toe game...
  (1) middle → side
  (2) middle → corner
  (3) corner → middle
  (4) corner → adjacent side
  (5) corner → opposite side
  (6) corner → adjacent corner
  (7) corner → opposite corner
  (8) side → middle
  (9) side → adjacent corner
  (10) side → opposite corner
  (11) side → adjacent side
  (12) side → opposite side

A game of Tic-tac-toe is short enough to simply remember what to do for various cases. You can verify by running the code that...
 • if Player 1 moves into the center, Player 2 should move into a corner (else Player 1 can force a win), then Player 1 should choose the opposite corner
 • if Player 1 moves into the corner, Player 2 should choose center (else Player 1 can force a win), then Player 1 should choose the opposite corner

However, these two start moves get boring very quickly, so the main goal is to explore the more complex and interesting situation when Player 1 begins on the side. If you're Player 1, I recommend sometimes starting on the side because your opponent may not know what to do!

See my comments at the top of the code to get started!
